OD was measured and 7x107 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 2ml Y1 medium (2ul beta-ME, 150ul zymolase) and incubated for 30min at 30C in a waterbath. After centrifugation, the pellet was lysed in buffer RLT and processed according to the yeast protocol of the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Yield and quality of totalRNA was measured with Nanodrop and confirmed by Agilent RNA Nano chip (RIN 10). A DNase digestion was performed on 20ug totalRNA using Turbo DNase (Life Technologies), followed by an RNeasy column cleanup step and elution into 30ul nuclease free water (Ambion). Poly(A) selection: 2 rounds of polyA selection were performed using the Truseq RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) with several modifications. In more detail: 50ul of DNase digested totalRNA was incubated with 50ul RNA Purification beads (oligo-dT) for 5min at 65C, cooled to 4C, and then incubated for 5min at RT in a DNA Engine tetrade 2 (Biorad) thermocycler. Afterwards, beads were separated with a magnet and washed with 200ul Bead Wash buffer, and then eluted in 50ul elution buffer for 2min at 80C. On RT, 50ul of binding buffer were added, placed on a magnet and washed with 200ul Bead Wash buffer, and again eluted in 50ul elution buffer for 2min at 80C. The supernatant containing the mRNA was transferred into a 1.5ml Low Binding tube (Eppendorf) and quantified with the Qubit RNA assay. Spike-in control: 20ul of spike in in vitro transcripts with a known A42 stretch (Pelechano V. et al., Nature. 2013 May 2;497(7447):127-31) were added. A cleanup step was performed using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) according to protocol eluting with 14ul water. G-tailing and fragmentation: The USB Poly(A) Tail-Length Assay kit (Affymetrix) was used with several modifications to add a short G stretch to the 3?ö£???ô?????ô?é??end of the mRNA. In detail, 14ul mRNA (with spike-in) were incubated with 4ul of 5xTail buffer mix and 2ul 10x Tail Enzyme mix at 37C for 1h and stopped by addition of 2ul 10x Tail stop solution. After an RNeasy Minelute cleanup step and elution into 18ul of water, chemical fragmentation using the NEBnext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation kit (NEB) was performed in 20ul for 3.5min at 94C. Afterwards, the reaction was immediately put on ice, and 2ul of RNA Fragmentation Stop Solution was added. Another RNeasy Minelute cleanup step was performed, eluting into 15ul of water. cDNA synthesis: 1ul TTTTVN (16.7uM) and 1ul CCCCCCTT (50uM) custom primers (both Sigma) were added to the 15ul fragmented RNA, primed by incubation at 65C for 5min and put on ice. 1st strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the 1st strand mastermix (Illumina Truseq RNA kit) and SuperscriptII enzyme (Life Technologies) by incubating at 25C for 10min, 42C for 50min at 70C for 15min, and cooled to 4C in a MJ-Mini thermocycler (Biorad). 2nd strand synthesis was performed by addition of 25ul 2nd strand master mix and incubation for 1h at 16C. NGS library preparation: An AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) cleanup step was performed by adding 90ul AMPure XP beads, vortexing and incubating for 15min at RT. After separation on a magnet, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with 200ul 80% ethanol. After air drying for 10min at RT, cDNA was eluted in 50ul Resuspension buffer and stored at -20C. End repair was performed by adding 10ul Resuspension buffer and 40ul Endrepair mix and incubating at 30C for 30min at 750rpm in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). After another AMPure XP cleanup step using 160ul beads and eluting into 17.5ul Resuspension buffer, the A-overhang addition step was performed. 12.5ul A-tailing mix were added and incubated at 37C for 30min at 750rpm, followed by 5min at 70C and put on ice. Adapter ligation used 2.5ul of a 1:40 dilution of Adapter oligo mix (Agilent Sureselect v4 kit), 2.5ul Resuspension solution and 2.5ul DNA ligase mix, incubated at 30C for 10min in a water bath and stopped by addition of 5ul Stop ligase mix. Adapter ligated cDNA library was cleaned up by 2 rounds of AMPure XP using first 42ul of AMPure XP beads and eluting in 50ul Resuspension buffer and then using 50ul AMPure XP beads and eluting in 40ul Resuspension buffer. Next, a size selection step was performed to create 4 technical replicates between 300-325bp, 325-350bp, 400-425bp and 425-450bp. For this, the purified adapter ligated cDNA was loaded on a 1.5% Agarose gel and separated for 2h at 120V. Using SybrSafe (Invitrogen) as dye and a Dark Reader transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research), narrow bands were cut using 100bp marker as guidance and gel extracted using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 22ul NE buffer. Two sequential rounds of PCR were performed to introduce barcodes and amplify the cDNA library. First, the Sureselect primer and Sureselect ILM Indexing Pre-Capture PCR reverse primer were used with the Phusion HF 2x mix in 50ul in a MJ Mini thermocycler as follows: 2min 98C, followed by 5 cycles of 30sex 98C, 30sec 65C, 1min at 72C, and a final 72C step for 10min. Next, an AMPure XP cleanup step was performed using 90ul AMPure XP beads and eluting into 23ul water. Afterwards, a 2nd PCR was performed using the Sureselect ILM Indexing Post Capture Forward PCR primer and a different PCR Primer Index primer/sample together with the Phusion HF 2x mix in 50ul in a MJ Mini thermocycler as follows: 2min 98C, followed by 13-15 cycles of 30sex 98C, 30sec 57C, 1min at 72C, and a final 72C step for 10min. After a final AMPure XP cleanup step using 90ul beads, the final library was eluted in 20ul water, quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit and pooled equimolarly."

Another RNeasy Minelute cleanup step was performed, eluting into 15ul of water. cDNA synthesis: 1ul TTTTVN (16.7uM) and 1ul CCCCCCTT (50uM) custom primers (both Sigma) were added to the 15ul fragmented RNA, primed by incubation at 65C for 5min and put on ice. 1st strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the 1st strand mastermix (Illumina Truseq RNA kit) and SuperscriptII enzyme (Life Technologies) by incubating at 25C for 10min, 42C for 50min at 70C for 15min, and cooled to 4C in a MJ-Mini thermocycler (Biorad). 2nd strand synthesis was performed by addition of 25ul 2nd strand master mix and incubation for 1h at 16C. NGS library preparation: An AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) cleanup step was performed by adding 90ul AMPure XP beads, vortexing and incubating for 15min at RT. After separation on a magnet, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with 200ul 80% ethanol. After air drying for 10min at RT, cDNA was eluted in 50ul Resuspension buffer and stored at -20C. End repair was performed by adding 10ul Resuspension buffer and 40ul Endrepair mix and incubating at 30C for 30min at 750rpm in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). After another AMPure XP cleanup step using 160ul beads and eluting into 17.5ul Resuspension buffer, the A-overhang addition step was performed. 12.5ul A-tailing mix were added and incubated at 37C for 30min at 750rpm, followed by 5min at 70C and put on ice. Adapter ligation used 2.5ul of a 1:40 dilution of Adapter oligo mix (Agilent Sureselect v4 kit), 2.5ul Resuspension solution and 2.5ul DNA ligase mix, incubated at 30C for 10min in a water bath and stopped by addition of 5ul Stop ligase mix. Adapter ligated cDNA library was cleaned up by 2 rounds of AMPure XP using first 42ul of AMPure XP beads and eluting in 50ul Resuspension buffer and then using 50ul AMPure XP beads and eluting in 40ul Resuspension buffer. Next, a size selection step was performed to create 4 technical replicates between 300-325bp, 325-350bp, 400-425bp and 425-450bp. For this, the purified adapter ligated cDNA was loaded on a 1.5% Agarose gel and separated for 2h at 120V. Using SybrSafe (Invitrogen) as dye and a Dark Reader transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research), narrow bands were cut using 100bp marker as guidance and gel extracted using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 22ul NE buffer. Two sequential rounds of PCR were performed to introduce barcodes and amplify the cDNA library. First, the Sureselect primer and Sureselect ILM Indexing Pre-Capture PCR reverse primer were used with the Phusion HF 2x mix in 50ul in a MJ Mini thermocycler as follows: 2min 98C, followed by 5 cycles of 30sex 98C, 30sec 65C, 1min at 72C, and a final 72C step for 10min. Next, an AMPure XP cleanup step was performed using 90ul AMPure XP beads and eluting into 23ul water. Afterwards, a 2nd PCR was performed using the Sureselect ILM Indexing Post Capture Forward PCR primer and a different PCR Primer Index primer/sample together with the Phusion HF 2x mix in 50ul in a MJ Mini thermocycler as follows: 2min 98C, followed by 13-15 cycles of 30sex 98C, 30sec 57C, 1min at 72C, and a final 72C step for 10min. After a final AMPure XP cleanup step using 90ul beads, the final library was eluted in 20ul water, quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit and pooled equimolarly."

OD was measured and 7x107 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 2ml Y1 medium (2ul beta-ME, 150ul zymolase) and incubated for 30min at 30C in a waterbath. After centrifugation, the pellet was lysed in buffer RLT and processed according to the yeast protocol of the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Yield and quality of totalRNA was measured with Nanodrop and confirmed by Agilent RNA Nano chip (RIN 10). A DNase digestion was performed on 20ug totalRNA using Turbo DNase (Life Technologies), followed by an RNeasy column cleanup step and elution into 30ul nuclease free water (Ambion). Poly(A) selection: 2 rounds of polyA selection were performed using the Truseq RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) with several modifications. In more detail: 50ul of DNase digested totalRNA was incubated with 50ul RNA Purification beads (oligo-dT) for 5min at 65C, cooled to 4C, and then incubated for 5min at RT in a DNA Engine tetrade 2 (Biorad) thermocycler.

"The replication of eukaryotic chromosomes is organized temporally and spatially within the nucleus through epigenetic regulation of replication origin function.  The characteristic initiation timing of specific origins is thought to reflect their chromatin environment or sub-nuclear positioning, however the mechanism remains obscure.  Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing.  Forkhead regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of transcription.  Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1-phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories.  Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins.

Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1-phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories.  Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins.

SRP022356	Inheritance of gene expression level and selective constraints on trans- and cis-regulatory changes in yeast	Study the gene expression patterns in two strains of yeast (BY and RM)	"Gene expression evolution can be caused by changes in cis- or trans-regulatory elements or both. As cis and trans regulation operate through different molecular mechanisms, cis and trans mutations may show different inheritance patterns and may be subjected to different selective constraints. To investigate these issues, we obtained and analyzed gene expression data from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and their hybrid, using high-throughput sequencing. Our data indicate that compared to other types of genes, those with antagonistic cis-trans interactions are more likely to exhibit over- or under-dominant inheritance of expression level. Moreover, in accordance with previous studies, genes with trans variants tend to have a dominant inheritance pattern while cis variants are enriched for additive inheritance. In addition, cis regulatory differences contribute more to expression differences between species than within species, whereas trans regulatory differences show a stronger association between divergence and polymorphism. Our data indicate that in the trans component of gene expression differences genes subjected to weaker selective constraints tend to have an excess of polymorphism over divergence compared to those subjected to stronger selective constraints. In contrast, in the cis component, this difference between genes under stronger and weaker selective constraint is mostly absent. To explain these observations, we propose that purifying selection more strongly shapes trans polymorphism than cis polymorphism."

The total RNA was spiked-in with the external RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control mixes (Ambion, 4456740) based on the same number of cells for each sample. The ERCC RNA Spike-In Control Mixes used here comprise a set of 92 polyadenylated transcripts that mimic natural eukaryotic mRNAs. The RNAs range in size from 250?ô?ç??2,000 nucleotides in length and span an approximately 106-fold concentration range.

SRP028893	Spliceosome-Mediated-Decay (SMD) regulates expression of non-intronic genes in budding yeast	"We report RNAseq data for two SM immunoprecipitation experiments and RNAseq datasets for the parental strain (BY4741), the prp40-1 mutant, and the rrp6?ò¼?ï strain."	"Purpose: The goals of this study were to determine whether the spliceosome interacts with non-intronic mRNAs;;Methods: RNAseq was performed on RNA that immunoprecipitated with the yeast SMD1 protein. Tandem-affinity-purified RNAs were extracted and RNAseq libraries were generated using the EpiCentre ScriptSeq kit (v1). We also performed RNAseq experiments on rRNA depleted total RNA extracted from an exosome mutant (rrp6?ò¼?ï), a temperature-sensitive splicing mutant (prp40-1) and a parental strain (BY4741). The rRNA was depleted using the Invitrogen RiboMinus kit, according to manufactureres procedures. The depleted RNA was subsequently treated with Turbo DNAse I (Ambion) and RNAseq libraries were generated using the EpiCentre ScriptSeq kit (v1).;;Results: The SM RNAseq data identified a number of non-intronic mRNAs that appeard to be bound by the spliceosome. Among these was the BDF2 mRNA, which enocdes for a bromo-domain protein. BDF2 was highly enriched in both SM-IP datasets and was therefore analyzed in more detail. To determine if other non-intronic mRNAs could be regulated by the spliceosome, we analysed the transcriptome in the rrp6?ò¼?ï, the prp40-1 and a parental strain. Bioinformatic analysis of these data sets revealed that roughly 1% of the non-intronic mRNAs in yeast could be targeted by the spliceosome. TopHat revealed cannonical splice junctions in roughly 30 non-intronic mRNAs, indicating that these messages are spliced.;;Conclusions: We demonstrate, for the first time, that the spliceosome can regulate expression of non-intronic mRNAs via one and/or two RNA cleavage events. We refer to this process as Spliceosome Mediated Decay (SMD)."

While studies have examined antisense transcripts of S. cerevisiae for inverse transcription in stationary phase and stress conditions, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the conditional specific evolutionary characteristics of antisense transcription between yeasts. Here we attempt to decipher the evolutionary relationship of antisense transcription of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cultured in mid log, early stationary phase, and heat shock conditions.;Results: Massively parallel sequencing of sequence strand-specific cDNA library was performed from RNA isolated from S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cells at mid log, stationary phase and heat shock conditions. We performed this analysis using a stringent set of sense ORF transcripts and non-coding antisense transcripts that were expressed in all the three conditions, as well as in both species. We found the divergence of the condition specific anti-sense transcription levels is higher than that in condition specific sense transcription levels, suggesting that antisense transcription played a potential role in adapting to different conditions. Furthermore, 43% of sense-antisense pairs demonstrated inverse transcription in either stationary phase or heat shock conditions relative to the mid log conditions. In addition, a large part of sense-antisense pairs (67%), which demonstrated inverse transcription, were highly conserved between the two species. Our results were also concordant with known functional analyses from previous studies and with the evidence from mechanistic experiments of role of individual genes.;Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the role of antisense transcription mediating sense transcription in different conditions across yeast species. We can conclude from our findings that antisense regulation could act like an on-off switch on sense regulation in different conditions."

SRP043037	Strand-specific transcriptomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus	"Transcriptomes of two yeast species under mid-log phase, early stationary phase, and after heat shock treatment were generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired-end sequencing"	"Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that antisense transcription is pervasive in budding yeasts and is conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. While studies have examined antisense transcripts of S. cerevisiae for inverse transcription in stationary phase and stress conditions, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the conditional specific evolutionary characteristics of antisense transcription between yeasts. Here we attempt to decipher the evolutionary relationship of antisense transcription of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cultured in mid log, early stationary phase, and heat shock conditions.;Results: Massively parallel sequencing of sequence strand-specific cDNA library was performed from RNA isolated from S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cells at mid log, stationary phase and heat shock conditions. We performed this analysis using a stringent set of sense ORF transcripts and non-coding antisense transcripts that were expressed in all the three conditions, as well as in both species. We found the divergence of the condition specific anti-sense transcription levels is higher than that in condition specific sense transcription levels, suggesting that antisense transcription played a potential role in adapting to different conditions. Furthermore, 43% of sense-antisense pairs demonstrated inverse transcription in either stationary phase or heat shock conditions relative to the mid log conditions. In addition, a large part of sense-antisense pairs (67%), which demonstrated inverse transcription, were highly conserved between the two species. Our results were also concordant with known functional analyses from previous studies and with the evidence from mechanistic experiments of role of individual genes.;Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the role of antisense transcription mediating sense transcription in different conditions across yeast species. We can conclude from our findings that antisense regulation could act like an on-off switch on sense regulation in different conditions."

Eluted RNA was reverse transcribed with 3 ?ö¼?òíl oligo dT18 with a VN anchor (1 ?ö¼?òíM, Invitrogen), 3 ?ö¼?òíl random hexamers 30 ng/?ö¼?òíl, Invitrogen) and 2 ?ö¼?òíl 10 mM dNTPs. The samples were incubated at 65?ö¼?ûæC for 5 min and ransferred to ice. 8 ?ö¼?òíl 5X First strand buffer (Invitrogen), 4 ?ö¼?òíl DTT 0.1 M, 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl Actinomycin D (1.25 mg/ml) and 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl RNasin plus RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added to each sample and the samples were then incubated at 25?ö¼?ûæC for 2 min. Following this, 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U/?ö¼?òíl, Invitrogen) was added. The retrotranscription was carried out at 25?ö¼?ûæC for 10 min, at 42?ö¼?ûæC for 50 min,  and inactivated at 70?ö¼?ûæC for 15 min. After cleanup, the 2nd strand cDNA synthesis was done with dUTPs  instead of dTTPs. For ligation, 1 ?ö¼?òíl of forked PE multiplexed adaptors (40 ?ö¼?òíM) was used. The dUTPs of the second strand were hydrolyzed by incubating the samples at 37?ö¼?ûæC for 30 min with 5 units of UDG in UDG reaction buffer (NEB). The samples were purified using 1X Ampure XP beads. After 10 cycles of PCR amplification and clean up, samples were submitted to the EMBL core facility for 100bp  paired end sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). DNA: A modified version of the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit   (Affymetrix, 78855 1 KT) based on enzymatic cell wall digestion was  used for the DNA isolation from yeast cells. All of the mixing steps  were performed by pipetting using a Biomek FX pipetting robot (Beckman  Coulter) in 96-well plates. Cell pellets from 4 deep-well plates, each  containing 1 ml overnight culture, were combined for the DNA  isolation. The Spheroplast and Enzyme Solution from the   kit was replaced by Qiagen   s Y1 lysis buffer (1 M sorbitol, 100 mM  EDTA, pH 8.0, 14 mM   -mercaptoethanol) freshly supplemented with 2.5  l/ml of Zymolyase (Seikagaku Inc.) and 2.5   l/ml RNase A (10 mg/ml,  Qiagen). 200   l of this buffer was added to each pellet, mixed and  incubated at 37  C for 90 min with gentle shaking every 30 min. 200  l of water was added to each well and the plate was centrifuged at  6000 x g for 4 min (for centrifuges with maximum 3,000 x g,  centrifugation times can be tripled) and the supernatant was decanted.  120   l Homogenization Buffer was added and mixed to resuspend the pellet completely. 100   l of chloroform and 400   l of Protein  Precipitation Buffer were added to the lysate and mixed. Plates were  centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. 450   l of the upper aqueous  phase was transferred with the robot (pipetting height was optimized  in advance) to a 1 ml deep-well plate containing 340   l of  isopropanol per well. The solution was mixed, left for 15 min at room  temperature, and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. After decanting   the supernatant, 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol was added to the pellet,  mixed and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the tube was placed upside down on a paper towel and dried for 5 min at 37  C. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 300   l of DNA Resuspension Buffer or Elution Buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris HCl) by shaking plates for 30 min at 37  C and later by mixing. DNA fragmentation was done with a Bandelin and a Covaris sonicator,  except for spore pool B, where only a Covaris fragmentation was applied. Instead of the standard column or bead-based cleanup steps,  we heat-inactivated the enzymes used for end repair, dA-tailing, and  ligation, then added the respective enzyme (+ buffer). DNA  Quantification: For quantification of genomic DNA and pre-PCR  libraries in 96-well plates, we used Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent  (Invitrogen) in optical plates (Greiner). The fluorescence was  measured at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission in a Genios  microplate reader (Tecan) according to the manufacturers  instructions. The pooled libraries were quantified before and after PCR with a Qubit spectro-fluorometer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. All pre- and post-PCR libraries were run on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent) to determine  the size distribution. The samples were then diluted to 10 nM and  clustered on the Illumina cBot clustering station for paired-end   sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000."

DNA  Quantification: For quantification of genomic DNA and pre-PCR  libraries in 96-well plates, we used Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent  (Invitrogen) in optical plates (Greiner). The fluorescence was  measured at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission in a Genios  microplate reader (Tecan) according to the manufacturers  instructions. The pooled libraries were quantified before and after PCR with a Qubit spectro-fluorometer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. All pre- and post-PCR libraries were run on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent) to determine  the size distribution. The samples were then diluted to 10 nM and  clustered on the Illumina cBot clustering station for paired-end   sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000."

SRP048715	Transcription profiling of a S96xSK1 yeast cross and its pool of spores.	RNA- and DNA-seq of a diploid S. cerevisiae hybrid and its haploid spores.	"To dissect local regulation into cis and trans contribution, we measured allelic differential expression in a hybrid cross of two yeast strains and compared it against allelic differential expression in a pool of spores of the same cross."	"DNA: see Wilkening et al. 2013 BMC bioinformatics. RNA: see Wilkening et al. 2013 NAR.;RNA: Total RNA was isolated by a standard hot phenol method and treated with RNase-free DNaseI using Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). For strand specific total RNA-Seq the libraries were prepared as described in Wilkening et al. 2013 NAR which is a modified protocol of Parkhomchuk et al. 2009 NAR. Briefly, 10 ?ö¼?òíg of total RNA were fragmented by incubating the samples at 80?ö¼?ûæC for 5 min in the resence of RNA fragmentation buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mM KOAc and 30 mM MgOAc). The fragmented RNA was purified using 1.5?ö£?? Ampure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Eluted RNA was reverse transcribed with 3 ?ö¼?òíl oligo dT18 with a VN anchor (1 ?ö¼?òíM, Invitrogen), 3 ?ö¼?òíl random hexamers 30 ng/?ö¼?òíl, Invitrogen) and 2 ?ö¼?òíl 10 mM dNTPs. The samples were incubated at 65?ö¼?ûæC for 5 min and ransferred to ice. 8 ?ö¼?òíl 5X First strand buffer (Invitrogen), 4 ?ö¼?òíl DTT 0.1 M, 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl Actinomycin D (1.25 mg/ml) and 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl RNasin plus RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added to each sample and the samples were then incubated at 25?ö¼?ûæC for 2 min. Following this, 0.5 ?ö¼?òíl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U/?ö¼?òíl, Invitrogen) was added. The retrotranscription was carried out at 25?ö¼?ûæC for 10 min, at 42?ö¼?ûæC for 50 min,  and inactivated at 70?ö¼?ûæC for 15 min. After cleanup, the 2nd strand cDNA synthesis was done with dUTPs  instead of dTTPs. For ligation, 1 ?ö¼?òíl of forked PE multiplexed adaptors (40 ?ö¼?òíM) was used. The dUTPs of the second strand were hydrolyzed by incubating the samples at 37?ö¼?ûæC for 30 min with 5 units of UDG in UDG reaction buffer (NEB). The samples were purified using 1X Ampure XP beads. After 10 cycles of PCR amplification and clean up, samples were submitted to the EMBL core facility for 100bp  paired end sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). DNA: A modified version of the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit   (Affymetrix, 78855 1 KT) based on enzymatic cell wall digestion was  used for the DNA isolation from yeast cells. All of the mixing steps  were performed by pipetting using a Biomek FX pipetting robot (Beckman  Coulter) in 96-well plates. Cell pellets from 4 deep-well plates, each  containing 1 ml overnight culture, were combined for the DNA  isolation. The Spheroplast and Enzyme Solution from the   kit was replaced by Qiagen   s Y1 lysis buffer (1 M sorbitol, 100 mM  EDTA, pH 8.0, 14 mM   -mercaptoethanol) freshly supplemented with 2.5  l/ml of Zymolyase (Seikagaku Inc.) and 2.5   l/ml RNase A (10 mg/ml,  Qiagen). 200   l of this buffer was added to each pellet, mixed and  incubated at 37  C for 90 min with gentle shaking every 30 min. 200  l of water was added to each well and the plate was centrifuged at  6000 x g for 4 min (for centrifuges with maximum 3,000 x g,  centrifugation times can be tripled) and the supernatant was decanted.  120   l Homogenization Buffer was added and mixed to resuspend the pellet completely. 100   l of chloroform and 400   l of Protein  Precipitation Buffer were added to the lysate and mixed. Plates were  centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. 450   l of the upper aqueous  phase was transferred with the robot (pipetting height was optimized  in advance) to a 1 ml deep-well plate containing 340   l of  isopropanol per well. The solution was mixed, left for 15 min at room  temperature, and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. After decanting   the supernatant, 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol was added to the pellet,  mixed and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the tube was placed upside down on a paper towel and dried for 5 min at 37  C. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 300   l of DNA Resuspension Buffer or Elution Buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris HCl) by shaking plates for 30 min at 37  C and later by mixing.

The Spheroplast and Enzyme Solution from the   kit was replaced by Qiagen   s Y1 lysis buffer (1 M sorbitol, 100 mM  EDTA, pH 8.0, 14 mM   -mercaptoethanol) freshly supplemented with 2.5  l/ml of Zymolyase (Seikagaku Inc.) and 2.5   l/ml RNase A (10 mg/ml,  Qiagen). 200   l of this buffer was added to each pellet, mixed and  incubated at 37  C for 90 min with gentle shaking every 30 min. 200  l of water was added to each well and the plate was centrifuged at  6000 x g for 4 min (for centrifuges with maximum 3,000 x g,  centrifugation times can be tripled) and the supernatant was decanted.  120   l Homogenization Buffer was added and mixed to resuspend the pellet completely. 100   l of chloroform and 400   l of Protein  Precipitation Buffer were added to the lysate and mixed. Plates were  centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. 450   l of the upper aqueous  phase was transferred with the robot (pipetting height was optimized  in advance) to a 1 ml deep-well plate containing 340   l of  isopropanol per well. The solution was mixed, left for 15 min at room  temperature, and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 15 min. After decanting   the supernatant, 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol was added to the pellet,  mixed and centrifuged at 6,000    g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the tube was placed upside down on a paper towel and dried for 5 min at 37  C. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 300   l of DNA Resuspension Buffer or Elution Buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris HCl) by shaking plates for 30 min at 37  C and later by mixing. DNA fragmentation was done with a Bandelin and a Covaris sonicator,  except for spore pool B, where only a Covaris fragmentation was applied. Instead of the standard column or bead-based cleanup steps,  we heat-inactivated the enzymes used for end repair, dA-tailing, and  ligation, then added the respective enzyme (+ buffer). DNA  Quantification: For quantification of genomic DNA and pre-PCR  libraries in 96-well plates, we used Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent  (Invitrogen) in optical plates (Greiner). The fluorescence was  measured at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission in a Genios  microplate reader (Tecan) according to the manufacturers  instructions. The pooled libraries were quantified before and after PCR with a Qubit spectro-fluorometer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. All pre- and post-PCR libraries were run on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent) to determine  the size distribution. The samples were then diluted to 10 nM and  clustered on the Illumina cBot clustering station for paired-end   sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000."

"Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by activating a checkpoint that depends on the protein kinases Tel1/ATM and Mec1/ATR. Mec1/ATR is activated by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which arises upon nucleolytic degradation (resection) of the DSB. Emerging evidences indicate that RNA processing factors play critical, yet poorly understood, roles in genomic stability. Here, we provide evidence that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA decay factors Xrn1, Rrp6 and Trf4 regulate Mec1/ATR activation by promoting generation of RPA-coated ssDNA. The lack of Xrn1 inhibits ssDNA generation at the DSB by preventing the loading of the MRX complex. By contrast, DSB resection is not affected in the absence of Rrp6 or Trf4, but their lack impairs the recruitment of RPA, and therefore of Mec1, to the DSB. Rrp6 and Trf4 inactivation affects neither Rad51/Rad52 association nor DSB repair by HR, suggesting that full Mec1 activation requires higher amount of RPA-coated ssDNA than HR-mediated repair. Noteworthy, deep transcriptome analyses do not identify common misregulated gene expression that could explain the observed phenotypes.

Here, we provide evidence that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA decay factors Xrn1, Rrp6 and Trf4 regulate Mec1/ATR activation by promoting generation of RPA-coated ssDNA. The lack of Xrn1 inhibits ssDNA generation at the DSB by preventing the loading of the MRX complex. By contrast, DSB resection is not affected in the absence of Rrp6 or Trf4, but their lack impairs the recruitment of RPA, and therefore of Mec1, to the DSB. Rrp6 and Trf4 inactivation affects neither Rad51/Rad52 association nor DSB repair by HR, suggesting that full Mec1 activation requires higher amount of RPA-coated ssDNA than HR-mediated repair.

We devised a new methodology, Break-Seq, that combines our previously described DSB labeling with NextGen sequencing to map chromosome breaks with improved sensitivity and resolution.  We show that DSBs preferentially occur at genes transcriptionally induced by HU.  Notably, different subsets of the HU-induced genes produced DSBs in MEC1 and mec1 cells as replication forks traversed greater distance in MEC1 cells than in mec1 cells during the recovery from HU.  Specifically, while MEC1 cells exhibited chromosome breakage at stress-response transcription factors, mec1 cells predominantly suffered chromosome breakage at transporter genes, many of which are the substrates of the said transcription factors.  We propose that HU-induced chromosome fragility arises at higher frequency near HU-induced genes as a result of destabilized replication forks encountering transcription factor binding and/or the act of transcription.  Our model provides an explanation for a long-standing problem in chromosome biology: why different replication inhibitors produce different spectra of chromosome breakage?  We propose that different inhibitors elicit different transcription responses as well as destabilize replication forks, and, when the two processes collide, ssDNA at the replication fork suffers further strand breakage, causing DSBs."

Relatedly, loss of proper transcriptional regulation on a global scale is an emerging aspect of shortened lifespan, but the specific mechanisms linking these observations remain to be uncovered. Here, we describe a lifespan screen in S. cerevisiae, designed to identify altered amino acid residues of histones that alter yeast replicative aging. Our results reveal that lack of sustained H3K36 methylation is commensurate with increased cryptic transcription in a set of genes in old cells and shorter lifespan. Deletion of the K36me2/3 demethylase Rph1 increases H3K36me3 within these genes and suppresses cryptic transcript initiation to extend lifespan. We show that this aging phenomenon is conserved, as cryptic transcription also increases in old worms.

Here, we describe a lifespan screen in S. cerevisiae, designed to identify altered amino acid residues of histones that alter yeast replicative aging. Our results reveal that lack of sustained H3K36 methylation is commensurate with increased cryptic transcription in a set of genes in old cells and shorter lifespan. Deletion of the K36me2/3 demethylase Rph1 increases H3K36me3 within these genes and suppresses cryptic transcript initiation to extend lifespan. We show that this aging phenomenon is conserved, as cryptic transcription also increases in old worms. We propose that epigenetic misregulation in aging cells leads to an increase in transcriptional noise that is detrimental to lifespan, and, importantly, this acceleration in aging can be reversed by restoring transcriptional fidelity."	"mRNA was purified from 5ug total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit (Ambion).;Since yeast genes are relatively short (average gene size ~1.3Kb), we chose to fragment the mRNA to ~40-50bp rather than the conventional 200-300bp size using RNA fragmentation reagents from Ambion. We believe that this gives better resolution over gene bodies to quantify 5?ô?ç?ö and 3?ô?ç?ö reads for estimation of cryptic transcripts. To do this, the fragmented RNA was phosphorylated by T4 PNK (NEB) and then size selected on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing urea.

SRP059949	Transcriptome-wide RNA processing kinetics revealed using extremely short 4tU labelling	"Three 4-thio-Uracil labeling time points, one rRNA depleted ribosomal RNA sample per experiment. All experiments were performed in triplicate."	"RNA levels detected at steady state are the consequence of multiple dynamic processes within the cell. In addition to synthesis and decay, many transcripts undergo processing. For example, in the case of intron-containing transcripts, there is splicing to take into the equation.  Metabolic tagging with a nucleotide analogue is one way of determining the relative contributions of synthesis, decay and conversion processes globally.  By using a much refined method of 4-thiouracil labelling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we can isolate RNA produced during as little as 1 min, allowing the detection of RNA species with high turn-over rates, including intron-containing pre-mRNAs and short-lived non-coding RNAs. Nascent RNA labelled for 1.5, 2.5 or 5 minutes was isolated and analysed by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR and RNA sequencing. From these data we measured the relative stability of pre-mRNA species with different high turn-over rates and investigated potential correlations with intron features. This extremely brief metabolic labeling method enables the isolation of short-lived RNA species and the production of transcriptome-wide high-resolution kinetic data with some unexpected results?ö¼?ª. Previous studies using reporter genes suggested that secondary structure in introns is favourable for efficient splicing and may affect splice site usage. In contrast, our data reveal that ribosomal protein transcripts with intron secondary structures that are predicted to be less stable, splice faster. These data, in combination with previous results, indicate that there is an optimal range of stability of intron secondary structures that allows for rapid splicing."

It has been proposed that TF binding can stimulate DSB formation nearby by modulating local chromatin structure. However, a prior study in TF bas1 mutant suggested that the role of TF binding in determining break formation is complex. Here, we examined fine-scale DSB distributions in TF mutant (bas1?ò¼?ï and ino4?ò¼?ï) strains.

Over-expression of Pde2p also suppresses the inviability of several mutants that normally cannot survive mtDNA loss. Moreover, Pde2p over-expression diminishes the nuclear transcriptional response to mtDNA damage, further supporting the idea that glucose sensation is harmful for cells lacking the mitochondrial genome.

The Gal11 KIX domain is engaged by pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factor (Pdr1) orthologues, key regulators of the multidrug resistance (MDR) pathway in S. cerevisiae and in the clinically important human pathogen Candida glabrata. Drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. glabrata most commonly harbour point mutations in Pdr1 that render it constitutively active, suggesting that this transcriptional activation pathway may represent a lynchpin in C. glabrata MDR. We have now carried out sequential biochemical and in vivo high-throughput screens to identify small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of the C. glabrata Pdr1 activation domain with the C. glabrata Gal11A KIX domain.

SRP070621	Cytosolic splice isoform of Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor Fes1 is required for the degradation of misfolded proteins in yeast	"4 strains (WT, fes1?ò¼?ï, fes1?ò¼?ïS, fes1?ò¼?ïL) were sequenced in triplicates from independent RNA isolations."	"Cells maintain proteostasis by selectively recognizing and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor Fes1 is essential for the degradation of chaperone-associated misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here we show that the FES1 transcript undergoes unique 3' alternative splicing that results in two equally active isoforms with alternative C-termini, Fes1L and Fes1S. Fes1L is actively targeted to the nucleus and represents the first identified nuclear Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor. In contrast, Fes1S localizes to the cytosol and is essential to maintain proteostasis. In the absence of Fes1S, the heat-shock response is constitutively induced at normally non-stressful conditions. Moreover, cells display severe growth defects when elevated temperatures, amino acid analogues or the ectopic expression of misfolded proteins, induce protein misfolding. Importantly, misfolded proteins are not targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These observations support the notion that cytosolic Fes1S maintains proteostasis by supporting the removal of toxic misfolded proteins by proteasomal degradation. This study provides key findings for the understanding of the organization of protein quality control mechanisms in the cytosol and nucleus."	Total RNA was extracted using RiboPure?ô?é??

SRP070621	Cytosolic splice isoform of Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor Fes1 is required for the degradation of misfolded proteins in yeast	"4 strains (WT, fes1?ò¼?ï, fes1?ò¼?ïS, fes1?ò¼?ïL) were sequenced in triplicates from independent RNA isolations."	"Cells maintain proteostasis by selectively recognizing and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor Fes1 is essential for the degradation of chaperone-associated misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here we show that the FES1 transcript undergoes unique 3' alternative splicing that results in two equally active isoforms with alternative C-termini, Fes1L and Fes1S. Fes1L is actively targeted to the nucleus and represents the first identified nuclear Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor. In contrast, Fes1S localizes to the cytosol and is essential to maintain proteostasis. In the absence of Fes1S, the heat-shock response is constitutively induced at normally non-stressful conditions. Moreover, cells display severe growth defects when elevated temperatures, amino acid analogues or the ectopic expression of misfolded proteins, induce protein misfolding. Importantly, misfolded proteins are not targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These observations support the notion that cytosolic Fes1S maintains proteostasis by supporting the removal of toxic misfolded proteins by proteasomal degradation.
